#### Creates and solves word search game.
WordSearcher generates a new word search puzzle with your input word, then tries to solve the puzzle.  It is not programmed to win every game.  It simply compares each letter of the word with all those available on the board, then randomly selects one.  Then, it looks to see if the next letter of the word is joining the prior, and so forth.  It plays more like a human, rather than a computer, so make the game more fun.  Each time you play, notice that the board changes each time, even for the same input word.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'word_searcher'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install word_searcher

## Usage

1) Add your word to a hash with `:word` symbol key, then pass the arguments to `WordSearcher.search(args)` like the example below.  If you don't pass any args, and just run `WordSearcher.search` it will return sample data for testing.

```
result = WordSearcher.search(word: 'austin')
```

2) The returned data will be in hash format like below:

```
{
  :word=>"austin",
  :found=>["a", "u", "s", "t", "i", "n"],
  :remaining=>[],
  :win=>true,
  :puzzle=>
    [
      ["l", "a", "w", "r", "h", "z", "b"],
      ["i", "p", "m", "b", "c", "j", "l"],
      ["k", "j", "h", "c", "t", "a", "y"],
      ["a", "u", "s", "t", "i", "n", "t"],
      ["d", "s", "o", "v", "f", "x", "h"],
      ["z", "d", "u", "a", "e", "k", "n"],
      ["q", "y", "l", "c", "s", "d", "u"],
      ["k", "z", "r", "m", "x", "g", "d"]
    ]
 }
```
